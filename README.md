# DokuWiki-Plugin: ID-Show

Simply shows the id of page at the top of the page. This is ofcourse completely unnecessary when using the default template.

The plugin is only meant for templates (e.g. sprintdoc) in which the id is not shown at all if the option to use the first title ist set. This can be confusing to beginners, thus this (simple) plugin.

The id is only shown to logged-in users (per css).
